                We are constantly faced with choices that lead us either toward darkness or into God’s light. 
                The darkness of sin blinds and separates us from God, leaving us feeling unworthy and lost. 
                The <strong>Seven Deadly Sins</strong>—<i>lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride</i>—represent destructive behaviors and attitudes that lead individuals away from God's light and onto paths of spiritual darkness.

                    Yet, <strong>God’s light</strong> offers us a path of redemption, hope, and purpose. 
                    By embracing the <strong>fruits of the Spirit</strong>—<i>love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness and self-control</i>—we can overcome the struggles of this world and live in unity with Him and one another.

                    Let us stand firm as <strong>children of light</strong>, reflecting God’s boundless love and peace. 
                    Even the smallest light can bring hope to the darkest corners through Love, Integrity, Generosity, Humility and Transformation. 
                    Together, we can shine brightly, dispelling darkness and leading others to His grace, goodness, righteousness and truth.
